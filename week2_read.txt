Week 2: Making Decisions & Repeating Tasks in Python

Theory Concepts: If-else statements: Teaching your program to make
simple decisions Comparison operators: equals, not equals, greater than,
less than For loops: Repeating tasks multiple times automatically While
loops: Repeating until a condition is met Functions: Creating reusable
blocks of code Basic error handling: What to do when things go wrong

Hands-On Practice: Create a program that gives different messages based
on time of day Build a number guessing game using if-else statements Use
for loop to print numbers from 1 to 100 Create a function that
calculates area of rectangle Make a simple calculator that can add,
subtract, multiply, divide Practice with real-life scenarios: grading
system, age categories

Project: Student Grade Calculator Build a program that takes student
marks and returns grade (A, B, C, etc.) with encouraging messages

Technical Requirements: Use if-elif-else statements for grading logic
Add input validation (marks 0-100 only) Create at least one function Add
encouraging messages for each grade Use while loop to handle invalid
inputs

Step-by-Step Guide: Day 1: Understand Grading System - Create grade
rules document Day 2: Create Input System - Get student name and marks
Day 3: Add Grading Logic - Implement if-elif-else conditions Day 4: Add
Validation and Loop - Check marks range, handle invalid inputs Day 5:
Create Final Program - Combine all parts, add functions, test thoroughly

Sample Output: Enter student name: Priya Enter marks (0-100): 85

RESULT FOR PRIYA: Marks: 85/100 Grade: B Message: Very Good! Keep it up!
